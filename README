"Modification of a Reward-Modulated Hebbian Learning Rule as a Model of Working Memory"
Final project for Bioengineering 260 - Neurodynamics, Fall 2014
Abstract: http://www.isn.ucsd.edu/classes/beng260/2014/index.html

Implementation of a recurrent neural network with random connections and reward-modulated Hebbian learning
Target function is a delayed non-matching to sample task (as with animal behavioral tasks with two levers)
